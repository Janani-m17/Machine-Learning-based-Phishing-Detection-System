# Machine Learning-based Phishing Detection System

Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication. It is a prevalent cyber threat that can lead to financial losses, identity theft, and other security breaches. Detecting phishing attempts is crucial to safeguard individuals and organizations from falling victim to such scams.

This project is a Machine Learning-based system designed to detect phishing URLs and Email/SMS spam. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and classification models for prediction. By analyzing the characteristics of URLs and textual content, the system can identify potential phishing attempts and provide warnings to users.

## Model Training

### Mail/Spam Detection Model

``` model.pkl ```
The mail/spam detection model was trained using a dataset of labeled emails and SMS messages. The training process involved the following steps:

1. Data collection: Gather a dataset containing examples of spam and legitimate messages.

2. Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the messages to extract relevant features such as word frequencies, presence of specific keywords, etc.

3. Model selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Neural Networks.

4. Model training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed data to learn the patterns and characteristics of spam messages.

5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.

6. Model deployment: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen messages.

### URL/Phishing Detection Model

``` model2.pkl ```
The URL/phishing detection model was trained using a dataset of labeled phishing URLs and legitimate URLs. The training process involved similar steps as above:

1. Data collection: Gather a dataset containing examples of phishing URLs and legitimate URLs.

2. Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the URLs to extract relevant features such as domain length, presence of hyphens, etc.

3. Model selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Neural Networks.

4. Model training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed data to learn the patterns and characteristics of phishing URLs.

5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.

6. Model deployment: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen URLs.
